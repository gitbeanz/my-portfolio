        Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm an undergraduate student at UC Irvine
        currently looking for new internship opportunities to learn and grow in
        the tech world.
      </p>

    <div id="about">
      <h1>ABOUT ME <img src="file_eye.png" /></h1>
      <p>
        I first discovered programming in middle school through block-based
        coding. My journey in learning about software development has been
        nonstop ever since.
      </p>

        I am a quick, avid learner with a passion for studying and replicating
        many art forms: music, film, fashion, photography, etc. To me, software
        is another form of art and a powerful one at that. I want to harness
        that power to improve the well-beings of others and to scratch my itch
        for creating cool things.

      <p>Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++</p>

      <h2>2048 Reverse-Engineered</h2>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
      <p>
        A popular (and personal favorite) web puzzle game remade from scratch.
        When I was learning JavaScript and came across DOM manipulation, I
        realized I could use what I had learned to recreate 2048 and got to work
        immediately. I implemented a stopwatch so that players can easily time
        themselves and used localStorage to store high scores.

      <h2>Inspiration Blog</h2>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
      <p>
        Personal blog that showcases albums and movies that inspire me and
        hopefully inspires the users who decide to check them out. Reviews of
        the albums can be read by hovering over the covers and clicking on the
        titles sends users to its respective Spotify page. I coded an image
        slideshow to display my favorite movies in more detail and added IMDB
        links for the movies and their directors. The contact form is automated
        using getform.

      <h2>Pokédex (Work in Progress)</h2>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Angular</p>
      <p>
        I want to learn the React library along with the Angular framework to
        create a website where users can look up information on Pokémon. I plan
        to use an API to gather data on Pokémon. Along with learning React and
        Angular, I want to learn more about design during this project in order
        to create better user interfaces.
