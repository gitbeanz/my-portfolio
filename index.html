        Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm an undergraduate student at UC Irvine
        currently looking for new job opportunities to learn and grow in the
        tech world.
      </p>

    <div id="about-div">
      <h1>about me <img id="about-img" src="assets/file_eye.png" /></h1>
      <p id="about-intro-p">
        I was born and raised in Lancaster, California. My hobbies mainly
        revolve around the appreciation & analysis of art in all of its forms:
        music, movies, photography, fashion, etc. I also enjoy powerlifting &
        gaming in my spare time.
      </p>

      <p id="about-tech-p">
        My love for software development & design stems from my innate
        creativity + curiosity & is powered by my passion for learning + solving
        problems. I want to use my skills to solve real-world problems &
        positively impact communities while simultaneously scratching my
        creative itch.

      <h2>Routine Manager</h2>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</p>
      <p>
        Productivity App that aims to help users create, customize, & execute
        routines. Features include timed tasks, a timer to keep track of track
        progress, & a user interface that helps guide users through their
        routines. I used this project to learn more about the React library.

      <h2>2048 Reverse-Engineered</h2>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
      <p>
        A popular (and personal favorite) web puzzle game remade from scratch.
        When I was learning JavaScript and came across DOM manipulation, I
        realized I could use what I had learned to recreate 2048 and got to work
        immediately. I implemented a stopwatch so that players can easily time
        themselves and used localStorage to store high scores.

      <h2>Inspiration Blog</h2>
      <p>
        Personal blog that showcases albums and movies that inspire me and
        hopefully inspires the users who decide to check them out. Reviews of
        the albums can be read by hovering over the covers and clicking on the
        titles sends users to its respective Spotify page. I coded an image
        slideshow to display my favorite movies in more detail and added IMDB
        links for the movies and their directors. The contact form is automated
        using getform.
