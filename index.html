        Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm an undergraduate student at UC Irvine
        currently looking for new internship opportunities to learn and grow in
        the tech world.

      <h1>ABOUT ME <img src="file_eye.png" /></h1>
      <p>
        I first discovered programming in middle school through block-based
        coding. My journey in learning about software development has been
        nonstop ever since.

        I am a quick, avid learner with a passion for studying and replicating
        many art forms: music, film, fashion, photography, etc. To me, software
        is another form of art and a powerful one at that. I want to harness
        that power to improve the well-beings of others and to scratch my itch
        for creating cool things.
